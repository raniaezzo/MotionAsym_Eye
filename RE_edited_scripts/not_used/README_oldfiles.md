	calculate_direction (used to be called calculate_degree): RE created a new script to replace this. Plots look roughly the same, but the RE script prevents negative values for better interpretability.
	
	countfigure: inside MS Characteristics section: countfigure(ms_new,tab,samplingRateData,data_path)
	
	drawfigure: inside MS Characteristics section: ms_new=drawfigure(MS_fil,samplingRateData,tab,data_path);
	
	draw_his: inside MS Direction Section: probably plots direction as a 2D histogram (not the polar plot)
